# <p align="center"> Predicting Bike Rental Ridership

In my first project in Deep Learning Nanodegree program at Udacity I built my 
first neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership. To do that,
I used the the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike%2Bsharing%2Bdataset])
from Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), 
University of Porto.

Effectively, I implemented foward propagation algoritm, backpropagation algoritm 
and some other functions to support the Neural Network to predict the rentals. 
The most important part implemented by me it is in `my_answer.py` file.
